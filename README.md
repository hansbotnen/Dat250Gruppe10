# Dat250Gruppe10

Creating an auction application with Java EE.

Delivery assignment 2:
1. Entities are created and mostly ready, but creating relations between them
   creates problems with LoadData, therefore this part is not done yet

2. Created a class "LoadData" to load data into the DB

3. REST api is working with both get and post, but not for the proper entities.
   We made the api to get and post to the account entity instead, this is because we 
   are trying to get LoadData to work on the other entites, but we wanted a functioning
   REST prototype for the delivery and presentation. 

4. We are properly connected to the PostgreSQL db 

The parts that are not yet done will hopefully be ready soon, such that we can continue
working on the next task.
