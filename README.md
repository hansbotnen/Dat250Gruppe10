# Dat250Gruppe10

Creating an auction application with Java EE.

Delivery assignment 4:

The frontend is a bit messy, but the most of our wanted functionality should be there.

Login is working and secure with https, and each user has a role either "user" or "admin".
There are no admin pages or functionality added, so admin is not actually used.

When an auction times out, the auction info will be sent to dweet.io using JMS.
